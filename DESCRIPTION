Description: Library of functions for multiple testing. Includes
	     resampling-based multiple testing procedures for controlling the 
	     family-wise error rate (FWER): Bonferroni, Hochberg (1988), Holm
	     (1979), Sidak, Westfall & Young (1993) (referred as minP and maxT in the tech report, 2001). Also
	     includes procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR):
	     Benjamini & Hochberg (1995), Benjamini & Yekutieli (2001) step-up
	     procedures. These procedures are implemented for tests based on
	     t-statistics, F-statistics, paired t-statistics, block F-statistics,
	     Wilcoxon statistics.  Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values. The procedures are directly applicable to identify differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.
