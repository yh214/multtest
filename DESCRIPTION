Description: Multiple testing procedures.
	Includes resampling-based multiple testing procedures for 
	controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER): Bonferroni, Hochberg 
	(1988), Holm (1979), Sidak, Westfall & Young (1993) (referred to as 
	minP and maxT). Also includes procedures for controlling the false 
	discovery rate (FDR): Benjamini & Hochberg (1995), Benjamini & 
	Yekutieli (2001) step-up procedures. These procedures are 
	implemented for tests based on t-statistics, F-statistics, 
	paired t-statistics,  block F-statistics, Wilcoxon statistics.  
	Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values. The procedures 
	are directly applicable to identify differentially expressed genes in 
	DNA microarray experiments.
